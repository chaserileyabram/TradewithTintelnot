# TradewithTintelnot

This repository houses materials by Chase Abram and Ignacia Cuevas during our replication/extension of the working paper "Import Tariffs and Global Sourcing" by Pol Antras, Evgenii Fadeev, Teresa C. Fort, Agustin Gutierrez, and Felix Tintelnot. A draft of this paper is not included because no working paper version has been publicly released yet.

In brief we [solve](https://github.com/chaserileyabram/TradewithTintelnot/blob/master/open_solve.jl) the model, then [consider the implications of various tariff and subsidy policies](https://github.com/chaserileyabram/TradewithTintelnot/blob/master/open_tariff.jl). The documentation for how we solve any given equilibrium is [here](https://github.com/chaserileyabram/TradewithTintelnot/blob/master/Solving_AFFGT.pdf), and the documentation for our tariff implication exploration (including a tariff game and tit-for-tat setup) are [here](https://github.com/chaserileyabram/TradewithTintelnot/blob/master/Optimal_Policies_AFFGT.pdf).

We also include some MATLAB code for the closed economy, which may be solved analytically.
